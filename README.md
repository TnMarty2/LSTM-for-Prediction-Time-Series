# LSTM-for-Prediction-Stocks-of-Indonesia-Banks-Time-Series

So this project mainly from my papers works to achieve a Bachelor's degree. Lets deep dive into it.
This code is a stock price prediction tool that uses an LSTM model to forecast stock prices for selected Indonesian bank stocks. It:

1. Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
2. Prepares and scales the data for use in an LSTM model.
3. Trains the LSTM model on past stock price data.
4. Predicts the stock price and evaluates accuracy with RMSE.
5. Plots and saves a comparison of actual vs. predicted prices.

The output includes the RMSE and a plot showing the prediction results.
